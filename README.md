## About
Full-stack framework for rapid application development.

“Less than 10% of code has to do with the ostensible purpose of a system. The rest deals with input-output, data validation, data structure maintenance, and other housekeeping.”
— Mary Shaw, Software Engineer and Carnegie Mellon Computer Science Professor

Portable Application Definition is a proposal for a convention-driven approach to isolating what's unique about a system.
- Specify everything that's unique in a PAD format
- Dynamically produce app behavior from PAD
